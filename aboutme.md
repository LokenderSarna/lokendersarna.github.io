I'm Lokender Sarna, a software engineer passionate about data science. 

I recently completed MSc in Computer Science and since then, working at CGI Inc as Technical Analyst. The best part about my masters was taking on practical projects involving predictive analytics, deep learning models, server design etc. and solve them with industry best practices like agile methodologies, pair programming. This grommed me to take on challenging roles with the IT industry. Prior to that, I worked at Hewlett Packard Enterprise where I was lead various initiatives in the field of automation, cloud computing, etc. to improve the existing tech stack apart from my regular role of ETL developer and product quality manager. My experiences there motivated me to pursue masters and explore the upcoming field of machine learning, AI etc. 

I feel technology is magic, it empowers you to create the reality you want and this motivates me to build products that bring efficiency and productivity to the masses.  

Got bored?

Apart for tech, I love volunteering for social entrepreneurship, try out new cuisines and trekking. 

Thanks for visiting.
